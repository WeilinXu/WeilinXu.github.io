									<h3> PlusAI </h3>
									<h4> Software Engineering Internship </h4>
									<h6> May 2019 - August 2019 </h6>
									<p> 
									I was a software engineer intern in PlusAI, an autonomous driving company.
									I worked in Planning Team and the project I was responsible for is
									planning algorithm development. 
									The goal was to develop path planning algorithm in lane-follow and lane-change 
									scenarios. The focus and challenge is to plan a path which avoids all encountered 
									obstacles, both static and dynamic. <br />
									<br />
									I regarded the problem as a 2D graph-search problem by discretizing the search space. The locations of the obstacles 
									where they threaten to our autonomous vehicle was spotted in the search 
									space, based on the predicted trajectories of our vehicle and obstacles. Then, I implemented Djisktra and A* algorithms, 
									with a well-designed cost function. In this way, the optimal path is found, under the constraints of lane boundary, obstacles, 
									and vehicle kinematics. All the algorithm was implemented in C++.<br />
									<br />
									The path planning algorithm was tested in the simulator and passed most test cases, indicating its good performance, 
									especially for lane-merge and nudge cases. 
									Finally, with the help of my mentor, the algorithm was tested on real road. The road test result verified the functionality 
									of the planning algorithm, while some parameters requires further tuning and testing.<br />
									<br />
									This is my first industry experience in both software development and autonomous driving. 
									I learnt how to read colleagues' code and write standardized code. More importantly, 
									my skill on Object-Oriented Design was significantly improved. Furthermore, my presentation and communication 
									skills were also improved through the experience of group meetings, code review and tech-sharing.<br />

									<h6> September 2018 - December 2018 </h6>
									<p>
									I was a graduate research assistant in Automotive Research Center, instructed by Prof. Stein.
									The project is Autonomous Vehicle Proving Grounds. The goal is 
									to develop an open-source self-driving simulator to evaluate the performance of 
									control and planning algorithms, such as nonlinear optimization, in Docker.<br />
									<br />
									My task was to realize vehicle dynamics simulation function using Chrono model and 
									obstacle detection function using Gazebo in ROS. For vehicle dynamics simulation part, 
									I implemented both PID and Pure Pursuit controllers so that the Chrono vehicle in the simulator 
									could follow the trajectory calculated by the nonlinear optimization which is to be evaluated.
									For obstacle detection function, 2D LiDAR model and ROS obstacle detection package were used.<br />
									<br />
									Under the cooperation of the whole team, all functions of the simulator were implemented properly, 
									and the simulator yielded expected simulation results for different nonlinear optimization methods.<br />

									<h6> May 2018 - August 2018 </h6>
									<p>
									My capstone design project in SJTU is sponsored by HUAYU Automotive Systems Co Ltd. 
									The goal of the project is to build a prediction model for vehicle's dynamic trajectory. 
									The results could be used for real-time automatic headlight adjustment. <br />
									<br />
									The baseline of the model was kinematic bicycle model implemented in Python and its performance was further 
									improved by test results. During the test, I applied Mean shift algorithm to track the trajectory of vehicle from camera, 
									and implemented B-spline non-rigid image registration to handle the distortion of the camera. In this way, the observed real path results
									of vehicle in global coordinate system were obtained, and used to make correction the model. 
									Finally, the prediction error for trajectory was reduced by 60% to 0.05m/m. A user interface was also 
									implemented using PyQt5 to visualize the predicted trajectory.

									<h3> 3D Bounding Box Estimation with Monocular Images </h3>
									<h4> Deep Learning Course Project </h4>
									<h6> March 2019 - April 2019 </h6>
									<p> The goal of the project is to detect and estimate 3D bounding box for objects using 
									only one monocular camera in autonomous driving scenario. Since the model does not require another camera 
									and LiDAR, the expense of autonomous driving could be reduced. <br />
									The model includes four components: Mask RCNN to detect the 2D pixel locations of objects (such as vehicle on the road), 
									Monocular Depth Estimation Model to generate disparity map, a two-layer CNN to convert disparity 
									map into 3D location of pixels, a 3D bounding box regression model to integrated the result of detection 
									and depth estimation. All codes were implemented using Pytorch. Although only a few trainings were 
									performed, the model still reached 51% accuracy for detection and 3D bounding boxes estimation of 
									vehicle objects. This result indicates that this model is promising.

									<h3> Autonomous Vehicle Control on a Pre-Defined Map with Unknown Obstacles </h3>
									<h4> Self-Driving Car Course Project </h4>

									(represented by kinematic bicycle model) to avoid random unknown static obstacles in a 
									pre-defined map during MATLAB simulation. 
									Since the obstacles were known once simulation started, the path using center line of the lane 
									as baseline with low-curvature sinusoidal cruve to avoid obstacles was designed. 
									Then, I designed and simulated PID/MPC controllers in MATLAB to follow the 
									planned path. The planner and controller were not only 
									robust but also computationally efficient,
